I am a M.S. student in [CompSec Lab](https://compsec.snu.ac.kr), Department
of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University.
I am advised by Prof. [Byoungyoung Lee](https://lifeasageek.compsec.snu.ac.kr).

I am interested in security for AI and system security in general. In particular, my research focuses
on **AI agent security**. I designed **Prompt Flow Integrity**, a system-level mitigation against
prompt injection attacks in LLM agents.
Building on this, my current research focuses on system-level defenses for web agents.

I am currently seeking internship or visiting researcher opportunities in the areas of
system security and AI agent security. If you are interested in collaborating or have opportunities
available, please feel free to reach out to me at [00cwooh@snu.ac.kr](mailto:00cwooh@snu.ac.kr).
