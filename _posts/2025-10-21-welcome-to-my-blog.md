Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, research, and experiences with you.

## What You'll Find Here

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- My research in security for AI and system security
- Technical tutorials and insights
- Conference experiences and paper discussions
- Interesting problems I've solved

## About This Blog

This blog is a space where I can share longer-form content than what fits in academic papers or social media posts. I hope you'll find the content here both informative and engaging.

## Adding Images to Posts

You can easily add images to your blog posts. Just place your images in the `/images/` directory (or a subdirectory like `/images/posts/`) and reference them in your post.

### Basic Image (Left-aligned)
```markdown
![Image description](/images/your-image.png)
```

### Centered Image (Recommended)

**Method 1: Using the built-in `.align-center` class**
```html
<img src="/images/your-image.png" alt="Description" class="align-center">
```

**Method 2: Using inline styles**
```html
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/your-image.png" alt="Description">
</p>
```

**Method 3: Using Kramdown's image attribute syntax**
```markdown
![Image description](/images/your-image.png){: .align-center}
```
